This is the R.E Mountain Typing Test.


Three technologies were used in this project:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Although this is a very simple iteration of a global phenomenom of online typing tests, it still has decent functionality, having 10 different combinations of texts, and all applicable statistics on typing speed. 



Thank you, and ENJOY TYPING!
